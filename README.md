# Game Project | "Cat Against Cucumbers"

## Introduction

As the first coding project during my Bootcamp, I had the chance to program a game with JS, HTML, and CSS.
I applied methods and techniques that I learned during my first 5 weeks at Ironhack.


## Setup

If youâ€™d like to view my project in your browser, please run the following lines in your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/LauraKapitza/Game-cat-against-cucumbers.git
$ cd game-project
$ open index.html
```

## Acknowledgment

While I was working alone on the project, I thank my teachers Antoine, and Elodie for their help.
Also, a big thank goes to Clement who pushed me to go further and try new things to make my game more interesting.
